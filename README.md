# Node_js-project
A movie Rental node js project.
to add back all the packages in your code npm i restores the node module folder; npm init restores the package.jsonfile
we use asynchronous js or none blocking ;  single thread, many calls can be executed at a go......
Http is a powerful module in node that helps build web servers. The http.server module is used as an event emitter. it is used to create a TCP or IPC server.
We use a framework called Express to handle various routes in a cleaner way. internally the express framework is built on top of the http module in Node.
Rest.....representational state transfer. It is a convention for building the HTTP services. in this project we build a http server thet gets, puts, posts and deletes data.
